# Notes

You can record notes using the in-game notes system (as a note to self).
Staff can assign "story" notes to you. These will show in their own column and are designed to inform you of important information staff has passed to you. You cannot delete story notes.

`notes` - Shows your notes.
`note/add <name>=<text>` - Create or update a note-to-self.
`note/delete <name>` - Deletes a note-to-self.

Admins can also set admin-visible notes on players.  See [Manage Notes](/help/manage_notes) for details.
